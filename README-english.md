Hi, I’m Yngrid!

An art director by day and an aspiring front-end developer by night.
This repository was created to document my learning journey into the world of development. I know it won’t be easy, but I’m excited about everything I’m discovering.

**Currently studying**<br>
Command line with WSL<br>
HTML5<br>
CSS3<br>
Git version control 

**Tools**<br>
Visual Studio Code<br>
Ubuntu via WSL<br>

You’ll find my month-by-month progress in the /progress subfolder.

My dev journey starts here!
